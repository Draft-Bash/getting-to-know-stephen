        <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Stephen and here are some things about me. First things first,
        I come from a large family. I have seven siblings. One of them is a Lewis
        alumni and the other is currently attending Lewis. So, I have continued the
        tradition. Before I transferred to Lewis, though, I attended Joliet Junior
        College. I plan on earning a math minor and a double major with
        computer science and data science
        </p>

        <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
        <p>
        My favorite hobby is cornhole tossing. It's really easy to pick it up.
        It's also full of strategy (do I slide it or "air-mail" it?).
        Cornhole is the perfect balance between competitiveness and chillness.
